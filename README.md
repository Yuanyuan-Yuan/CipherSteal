# CipherSteal

Research Artifact of IEEE S\&P 2025 Paper: *CipherSteal: Stealing Input Data from TEE-Shielded Neural Networks with Ciphertext Side Channels*

## Data and model

All our attacked neural networks and the collected side-channel traces are provided at: https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yyuanaq_connect_ust_hk/ElkJLviyGUJAsL_kwMNL8o0BruRgPLFoZztVg2R8E46L2Q?e=ChbLYs

## Examples of recovered inputs

We have provided thousands of examples of recovered videos and images at: https://sites.google.com/view/cipher-steal/examples


## Code

Our code is currently provided at: https://sites.google.com/view/cipher-steal

We will soon merge the code into this repo.
